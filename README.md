Nginx, slim and distroless to be used behind a reverse proxy or as full version as a proxy

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

nginx (engine x) is an HTTP web server, reverse proxy, content cache, load balancer, TCP/UDP proxy server, and mail proxy server.

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will serve as a base for nginx related images that need a high-performance webserver. The default tag of this image is stripped for most functions that can be used by a reverse proxy in front of nginx, it adds however important webserver functions like brotli compression. The default tag is not meant to run as a reverse proxy, use the full image for that. **The default tag does not support HTTPS for instance!**

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image has no shell since it is [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image verifies external payloads if possible
>* ... this image is very small

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

The default configuration contains no special settings. It enables brotli compression, sets the workers to the same amount as n-CPUs available, has two default logging formats, disables most stuff not needed and enables best performance settings. Please mount your own config if you need to change how nginx is setup.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [1.28.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/nginx/tags?name=1.28.0)
* [stable](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/nginx/tags?name=stable)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:1.28.0``` you can use ```:1``` or ```:1.28```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# PARENT IMAGE üèõÔ∏è
> [!IMPORTANT]
>This image is not based on another image but uses [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) as the starting layer.
>The image consists of the following distroless layers that were added:
>* [11notes/distroless](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/arch.dockerfile) - contains users, timezones and Root CA certificates
>* [11notes/distroless:curl](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/curl.dockerfile) - app to execute HTTP requests

# BUILT WITH üß∞
* [nginx](https://nginx.org)

# GENERAL TIPS üìå
> [!TIP]
>* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx, HAproxy to terminate TLS and to protect your endpoints
>* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to obtain valid SSL certificates for your services
